Features
========

* Scale the SVG properly according to window size
* Option to rotate the bead, or to flip horizontally or vertically
* Some visual way of indicating what parts of the bead can be clicked
* Up/Down key press:  Increment/Decrement barcodes?

Bugs
====

* Fix issue with spinner button in the number field.
  
  Update:  This is browser-dependent and can't be suppressed easily.
  The scalability issue is a bug with Firefox.  It's better to leave it alone.
  
* Set the barcode to 0 when the barcode value input text is invalid (or empty),
  and when the field loses focus.
  
  
Miscellaneous
=============

* Do thorough testing on the input field inputs.
